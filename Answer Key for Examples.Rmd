1. You just got your BB gun for Christmas but all is for naught because an astroid is bearing down on Earth! The astroid is $1  \times 10^{15} kg$ and moving at $2 \times 10^{4} m/s$. Fortunatly you have quite a few BBs which weigh $0.0002 kg$ and you can fire them at $60 m/s$. How many BBs will it take to stop the astroid and save Earth?

Answer: Using $m_{astroid}v_{astroid}=x \times m_{bb}v_{bb}$. We can calculate that it will take $1.67 \times 10^{21}$ BBs to reduce the momentum of the astroid to 0.


2. Rank these cars by their momentum.
  * Car 1: $800 kg$ going $1 m/s$
  * Car 2: $1000 kg$ going $2 m/s$
  * Car 3: $90 kg$ going $8 m/s$
  
Answer: Using $\rho = mv$, we canrank the cars by momuntum as 2,1,3 in highest to lowest momentum.
